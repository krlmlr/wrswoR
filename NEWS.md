# wrswoR 1.1.1 (2020-07-26)

- In `sample_int_expj()`, move retrieval of top element into the loop, to make it independent from the actual implementation of the priority queue.


# wrswoR 1.1 (2018-02-02)

- Use microbenchmark package conditionally.
- Remove dependency on cluster.
- Use native method registration.
- Prepare for submission to R Journal.
- Improve vignette.
- Internal tweaks.
